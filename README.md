# React Clicky Game
This is a simple memory challenge game, when the player clicks an image adds a point and the images rearrange on the screen, if the user clicks the same image the games is over.

## Getting Started
* Before starting with you need to install Nodejs and have basic understanding of it and npm (node package manager) this is the official line for the documentation [Nodejs Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), also know how to clone repositories from Github to your local machine [Git Reference](https://www.git-scm.com/docs). 

## Installing and Starting the app locally

Clone the app from this repository to you local drive of you PC (previously I recomended to have knowledge of how to clone repositories and where to find the information) and go to the root directory of the project, then run the command

```
npm install
```
This will take a while, but should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

To see how the app runs on line you can use this link [clicky-game](https://react-clicky-game.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
